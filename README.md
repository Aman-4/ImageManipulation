# Using the Python Imaging Library, this project demonstrates:
# My understanding of an Image object as a 2-d list of pixels
# Understanding of a pixel as r,g,b values (or r,g,b,a values) 
# Use of nested loops to iterate through the pixels in an image 
# Drawing text using ImageDraw 
# Using ImageFont to include a TrueType font 
# Retrieving image files over the web 
# Reading text files
